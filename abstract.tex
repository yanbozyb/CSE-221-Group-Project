    The project report presents a comprehensive study on various aspects of computer systems, focusing on CPU scheduling and operating system services, memory, network, and file system performance. Key experiments include the measurement of procedure calls, system calls, task creation, context switch time, RAM access time, memory bandwidth, page fault service time, round trip time, peak bandwidth, and connection overhead. We conducted experiments on an AWS EC2 Instance, acknowledging the impact of virtualization on their results. The study offers insights into the underlying behavior of computer systems and validates these findings against their predictions and hardware specifications.
