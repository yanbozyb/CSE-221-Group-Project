- fork_test: simply make
- pthread_create_test: you need to patch GNU LIBC manually, please follow the steps here
    - Patch `nptl/pthread_create.c`, call rdtsc() before `clone3` when creating thread.
    - Store the result of `rdtsc()` in a global variable.
    - If we want to dynamically link the patched library, make sure you expose the symbol, you can check with `nm -D ./your_libc | grep your_global_variable`.
    - You can statically link the patched library, then you can simply use the Makefile in `pthread_create_test` folder. Please make sure you have correctly set the environment variable `glibc_install`.
    - Run `./pthread_create_test` to see the result.
